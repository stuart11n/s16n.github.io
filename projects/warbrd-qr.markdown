---

This is a Quick Release for the Virpil WarBRD-D and MongoosT-50CM3. 

![](/assets/wbqr/wbqr1.jpg){: .center-image }

This was designed for a dual use racing/flight simrig but would work just as well for flightsim only. 

The stalk places the top of the stalk (the bottom of the flightstick base) maximum 20cm above the cross-member. The minimum is 5cm, which would allow the use of a regular flight stick extension. Specify the desired stalk height when ordering. 

The QR mount sits on the 4080 cross-member, it has a channel to route the USB cable across the profile back under the seat.  The position of the cross-member should allow for mounting vertically, per the photos. If you have specifical mounting requirements, or questions, let me know; the design has some leeway.

The base can be optionally rotated 15 degrees counter-clockwise, though usually it's better to do that on the flightstick interface.

A USB cable is included, connecting to the flight stick base (Virpil GX12-4L) and on the rig end, USB-A to your USB hub.

Includes mounting hardware for 4080 profile.

Updates: 

- February 2025 - the top-plate was redesigned when support for the MongoosT was added.
