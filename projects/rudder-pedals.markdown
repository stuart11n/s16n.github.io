title: Rudder Pedals
---

I designed these rudder pedals to be bolted to the underside of a racing rig pedal plate. 

### Features

- 3D printed, with 8mm linear rod and bearings and RC shocks
- toe brakes and rudder control
- AS5600 magnetic position sensors on all three axis 
- USB-C

### Planned modifications

- adjustable pedal angle
- quick release spring tension for rotary flight
- experiment with a stepper motor for providing the centering force, replacing the springs. This could also provide force feedback
- build simplification

### Previous Version

This is my initial design. The rudder control works really well, but I didn't include brakes. So I hacked on brakes using load cells (pictured) and although they work they don't have good feel leading to the redesign.
