title: Simrig Isolators
---

If your rig has bass shakers, buttkickers, transducers, or HPR, isolators are great idea. I designed these isolators to work on my 40-series profile rig, because it was creating quite a lot of vibration in the house (wooden floors), but I wanted the ability to move the rig.

I got the idea from drummers, you use tennis balls sandwiched betweensheets of plywood to isolate eletronic drum kits in apartment buildings. The the result is great and very cost-effective.

- by decoupling the rig from the floor, FFB and bass shaker effects become more distinct as they are no longer damped by the building, more energy is concentrated into the rig and they don't need to work so hard
- it's quieter for you're neighbors and family
- these isolators are very good on hardwood/tiled floors as they won't damage the floor and the rig will be quite easy to slide around 
- fits 40-series profile
- includes M8 x 20mm & profile nuts
