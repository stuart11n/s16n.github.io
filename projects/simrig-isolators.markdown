title: Simrig Isolators

If your rig has bass shakers, buttkickers, transducers, HPR, simrig-isolators it's a good idea to isolate it from the floor.

- by decoupling the rig from the floor, FFB and bass shaker effects become more distinct as they are no longer damped by the building, more energy is concentrated into the rig!
- the isolators are very good on hardwood/tiled floors as they won't damage the floor and the rig will be quite easy to slide 
- fits 40-series profile
- includes M8 x 20mm & profile nuts
- easy to fit
