If your rig has bass shakers, buttkickers, transducers, or HPR, isolators are great idea.

- by decoupling the rig from the floor, FFB and bass shaker effects become more distinct as they are no longer damped by the building, more energy is concentrated into the rig!
- it's quieter for you're neighbors and family
- these isolators are very good on hardwood/tiled floors as they won't damage the floor and the rig will be quite easy to slide around 
- fits 40-series profile
- includes M8 x 20mm & profile nuts
- easy to fit
