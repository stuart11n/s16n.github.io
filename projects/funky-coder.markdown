I fly and drive in VR only. I have built several button boxes, but eventually decided it would be much easier to use a single multi-mode device that's easy to get my hands on while playing.

### Features

- a 7-way funky switch that appears as a HAT, the encoder is exposes as two buttons
- a dual encoder with push button, exposed as 5 buttons
- USB-C

Inputs can be mapped in game as a normal HID device.

For aviation, if you use SPAD.next very cool things are possible. It can map the dual encoder to fast/slow increments on the PFD/MFD e.g. for heading or altitude.

SPAD.next also allows the button to be used for multiple inputs. So for example, by mapping funky down to mode change, it can cycle through different inputs altitude -> heading -> vertical speed -> barometer and it will announce the mode using speech. An example SPAD.next profile is included.

For VR users, this is really fantastic because you aren't fumbling around, there is just one knob (though you can naturally add more).

Any input can be used as mode change; mapping a switch on your flightstick for works well as you have one hand switch modes and the other adjusting. It's very smooth. In addition you can also add modes to the funky switch! Setting up the rules in SPAD.next *is* a little time consuming but it's worth it.

I use the weapon select switch on my flight stick so I can switch modes rapidly. HOTAF: Hand On Throttle And Funky-coder :-)
