I fly in VR only. I thought it would be fun to have dedicated landing gear and flaps controls in the same form-factor

### Features

- flaps has 5 detents
- landing gear has end detents
- FAA style knobs
- USB-C

These use a custom designed internal mechanism using a AS5600 magentic position sensor. The flaps are therefore a full analog axis with detents. The landing gear is also an axis, but it is mapped to button presses as MSFS cannot map an axis to the landing gear.

They are currently not available for purchase. I plan to sell a single device that includes a Funky-Coder, flaps and landing gear with a single USB-C connection, the photo shows a prototype.
