I thought it would be fun to have dedicated landing gear and flaps controls in the same form-factor as Funky-coder. Then combined them into one device.

### Features

- flaps has 5 detents
- landing gear has end detents
- FAA style knobs
- plus all the features of Funky-coder
- USB-C

These use custom designed internal mechanisms using AS5600 magnetic position sensors. The flaps are therefore a full analog axis with detents. The landing gear is also an axis, but it is mapped to button presses as MSFS cannot map an axis to the landing gear.
